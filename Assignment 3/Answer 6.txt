Advantages of using OO
1. more flexible for future addition
2. can be used for bundling related data
Advantages of using Dictionaries
1. they are faster
2. literal syntax, can directly start writing a dict without setting up a class.


Disadvantage of using OO
1. not universal, cannot be used everywhere or in all languages.
2. slower as comapred to dictionaries

Disadvantage of using dictionaries
1. keys are immutable
2. they are unordered

Performance comparison for grading operation (give in each line: value of N; time taken by two approaches in seconds, and which is faster and by how much).
1. N: 1000
2. Time by OO: 19.08109908703003 seconds
3. Time by dictionary: 0.7412159442901611
4. X is faster; fraction of time x took is: Dictionary; took 0.0399455582 time of the time taken by OO.

Performance comparison for search operation (give in each line: value of N; time taken by two approaches in seconds, and which is faster and by how much).
1. N: 50
2. Time by OO: 1.0042271614074707
3. Time by dictionary: 0.05801105499267578
4. X is faster; fraction of time x took is: Dictionary; took 0.0577668651 time of the time taken by OO.
