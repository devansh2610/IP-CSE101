Print the pattern given below using recursion - no loops are allowed. You are given a value n - print a diamond which will have 2n-1 rows, and 2n columns, as shown in the figure (In the top row print n+n stars, in the next (n-1) stars on left and right and 2 blanks in the middle, and so on till you have 1 star each on left and right; then you reverse this).

Suggestion: Have two recursive functions - one to print the top half, and other to print the bottom half.
